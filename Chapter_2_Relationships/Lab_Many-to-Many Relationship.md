# Lab: Many-to-Many Relationship

Problem:

Given the following Collection Relationship Diagram (CRD), identify the relationships that represent Many-to-Many relationships.

We are asking you to identify not only direct Many-to-Many relationships, but also transitives ones. For example a user has a One-to-Many relationship with its reviews and a One-to-Many relationship with its credit cards, making a Many-to-Many relationship between the reviews and the credit cards.
